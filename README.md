# myreadme

I did not understand how to pull a request, how to commit repositories, and how to create a markdown file. However, I did understand how to make suffient use of different typing styles on the github platform, for example, typing in italics, bold, underlining and many more.
i have a myraid of hobbies, which include reading romance novels, exercising at the gym, i participate in cheerleading and I also write poetry.
I am interested in learning Astronomy and Astrophysics but not for career purposes, I am planning on pursuing a career in Medicine (MBCHB) or even Occupational Therapy. My first love has always been the faculty of Health Sciences. 
I can be described as a determined character that loves to stick to a solid routine. I am a creature of habit and thrive in environments that challenge me both mentally and physically.
